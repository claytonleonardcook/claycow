			<h1>üåæ Hello, I'm Clay üêÑ</h1>

				I'm a cow furry who's also a software engineer, specifically in
				frontend development. Some of my main interests include creating
				applications, shaders, algorithmic art and discussing current
				social issues. This website is a place for me to aggregate and
				fully express my viewpoints through blogging.

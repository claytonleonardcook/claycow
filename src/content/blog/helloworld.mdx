Hey all, I finally decided to redo this domain so that I could put blogs on it. Expect to find blogs about algorithmic art, software and social issues on here. 

## Why make a blog?

I've been wanting to make a blog for a while since moving to Bluesky. I find it cool that they don't hide posts that link to websites outside of the platform and allows for people to link to their works on their own personal sites where they can fully customize the experience. Another reason for making a blog is it allows me to make longer form content which is a New Year's resolution for me. I've gotten tired of the predatory algorithmns on other platforms like Instagram, Twitter and even YouTube. I've started to move away from them (removing them from my phone for now to deter me) and engage it content that might be more useful like longer videos, books, blogs, etc. 

## How did I make this blog?

Currently this website is made using Astro.js, a component framework like React, which makes it really easy to write blogs. Basically, I'm writing in a MDX file which is really easy to edit and then I upload it to my GitHub where Vercel builds all the content using the included MDX files. MDX files are really cool because they let me insert any kind of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> that I want but also apparently framework-specific components. I'm not super interested in the components but I am interested in putting interactive graphs in here. 

## Will the site change?

Yeah, probably. I think I'd like to integrate this site with Bluesky by finding some way to make a comment section that's linked to a post that includes the URL to this blog post in it. Then, I and also other readers could see conversations that are happening on my blog posts and maybe interact with them. I'd also like to integrate Google Analytics for tracking which blogs get the most views and maybe have an ad or two around to help pay for the domain. I guess we'll see.

For the rest of the blog I'm just going to insert links to random things to see how things embed and how they appear on the website.

I had previously been in therapy back in 2023 but had stopped due to my therapist having a medical family emergency and the lack of value I felt that I was getting from it. Through that therapy, I got diagnosed with ADHD and majority of the conversations in therapy were repeatedly talking about the same few scenarios in my life. This blog isn't going to go depth into my own personal issues but more into my most recent interactions with a type of therapy I wasn't aware of before, Schema Therapy, and some helpful realizations I've come across.

## What is Schema Therapy?

> An early maladaptive schema is a broad, pervasive theme or pattern; comprised of memories, emotions, cognitions, and bodily sensations; regarding oneself and one's relationships with others; emerging during childhood or adolescence; developed throughout one's lifetime; and dysfunctional to a significant degree.

The basis of Schema Therapy revolves around the word "schema". A schema can be thought of as a lens in which someone views the world through. Many schemas are developed in our early life but are open to be changed, whether that's through an impactful event, therapy, or personally working on them. On the surface, schemas might be categorized by being "good or bad" but I find that a better perspective is to see the as **protective**. One doesn't develop a maladaptive schema arbitrarily and are formed to protect the individual based on their specific environment and situations.
